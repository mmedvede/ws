WorkSpace tools
================

Tools that augment the standard rosws / wstool / rosinstall and add missing functionality.

What is missing:
 * an easy way to save the state of the workspace: rosinstall --generate-versioned-rosinstall was broken. Even if it did work, it does not make it easy to create an initial workspace from a folder full of packages under source control.
